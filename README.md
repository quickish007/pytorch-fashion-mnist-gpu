# Fashion MNIST - ANN (GPU Version)

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using PyTorch to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Unlike the earlier version trained on a CPU with a subset of 6,000 images, this version uses the **entire dataset (60,000 training images)** and is **trained on a GPU**, achieving an improved accuracy of **88%**.
